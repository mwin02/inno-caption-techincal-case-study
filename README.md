Technical Case Study

Imagine youâ€™re tasked with creating a web page for an e-commerce platform using React. This platform requires interaction with a product database, which for the purpose of this exercise will be this dummy API: https://dummyjson.com/docs.

Customers should be able to:

- See a list of purchasable products
- Add, edit, and delete items from their cart
  - NOTE: The dummy API will not actually perform the action on the server but the page should reflect the action correctly after the API call is successful
- Search for products by name or category

You are free to use design libraries like Bootstrap or Ant Design and any other tools you find necessary.
